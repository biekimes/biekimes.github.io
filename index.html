            Welcome to Bum's Web Dev Portfolio Page
        </h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Bum and I am a web developer. I hammered this page out in like 10 minutes just as a respository for
            my
            other projects so bear in mind this is a work in progress! Click on <a href="about.html">About Me</a> to
            learn more about my
            programming experience and about me in general.</p>

        <p>Go to <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> to check out the web projects I've made, and <a
                href="contact.html">Contact
                Me</a> if you like what I can do and would
            like to work with me!</p>

        <p>
            Other than trying to be a web dev, I sometimes pretend to be a writer, a dancer, or a surfer. I love
            traveling and dogs as well so you may see my other passions bleed through into my coding projects.
