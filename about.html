            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>My name is Bum. Weird name, I know. I've embodied my weirdness with a Diogenic spirit and an intent to live
            the life I want. </p>

        <p>After working in translating, advertising, and education, I started learning programming to obtain a
            skill I can build upon and one that I can take anywhere in the world.</p>

        <p>
            I started by learning the usual: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own through online resources. Then I
            attended an offline bootcamp at a coding school in Seoul to learn Front-End Web Development and Web Design.
            There, I learned JS libraries and frameworks like JQuery, React, and BootStrap. I learned how to set up
            environments like Node.js, as well as becoming familiar with design tools like Figma and Kakao Oven.</p>

        <p>You can check out my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> to see what I can do, but like most things in
            life, this is a continuous learning process and I will add more to my skills and experience as time goes on.
        </p>

        <p>Things I'm into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Code</li>
            <li>Surf</li>
            <li>Dance</li>
            <li>Dogs</li>
            <li>Travel</li>
            <li>Writing</li>
        </ul>
